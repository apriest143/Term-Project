1. The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.

  The main Goal of this project is to create a functional web application that can isolate and store key information like dates, times, and topics from various event fliers. The MVP will involve text recognition in photos, and utilize an api to output a tentative schedule based on the events derived from the photo in an ICS format. A stretch goal is vocal recognition where a user could simply speak the information based around the event into the system and it would automatically store the information in a schedule.

3. Learning Objectives: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.

  Shared objectives: better understand 

4. Implementation Plan: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.

5. Project Schedule: You have roughly 4-5 weeks to complete the project. Create a general timeline. Depending on your project, this could be a detailed schedule or just an overview. As the project progresses, youâ€™ll likely need to revise this schedule.


6. Collaboration Plan: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.


7. Risks and Limitations: What do you think is the biggest risk to the success of your project?


8. Additional Course Content: Are there any course topics or content you think would be helpful for your project?
