1. The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.

  The main Goal of this project is to create a functional web application that can isolate and store key information like dates, times, and topics from various event fliers. The MVP will involve text recognition in photos, and utilize an api to output a tentative schedule based on the events derived from the photo in an ICS format. A stretch goal is vocal recognition where a user could simply speak the information based around the event into the system and it would automatically store the information in a schedule.

2. Learning Objectives: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.

{Shared objectives: Understand and implement computer vision in a real world functional manner. Build a program that can iteratively add information to a database and output desired messages at specific times.}

{Andrew: Better understand API's and the process of moving data and working with it across multiple platforms. The backend process is often very confusing to me so working with how information is transferred and stored in very intriguing.}

{Cole:}

3. Implementation Plan: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.

  {We will require the means to utilize computer vision in this project. Finding information on this will be easy, but implementing it will certainly pose its fair share of problems. We have noted some areas of interest COLE BRO WHAT ARE THESE but will require further research into the topic to make significant headway. We also are undecided on how the output (reminders) will be delivered to the user. There are many possible routes to solving this, but choosing an effective and feasible one will certainly take some theorizing. If vocal regonition is attempted this will take additional exploration of online resources, APIs, and language models.}

4. Project Schedule: You have roughly 4-5 weeks to complete the project. Create a general timeline. Depending on your project, this could be a detailed schedule or just an overview. As the project progresses, youâ€™ll likely need to revise this schedule.

{Week 1 and 2: build out information pipeline. When data is put into the system where is it stored? What characteristics does the information have? how can we utilize these characteristics to make broad, but consistent classifications? What platform will our output reside on, and  what form will it take?}

{Week 3 and 4: Implement computer vision. Connect our completed information pipeline with a program that can utilize computer vision, allowing us to simply snap a photo of an event and let the program do the rest. This is given extra time due to likely complications that will arise due to working with new technologies for the both of us. }

{Week 5: Build out front facing web app. This will be a relatively quick part of the process as it will mainly focus on connecting the various parts of the project together. This must be done last as we will not know what functionality this app requires until we determine the optimal form that our output will take.}

5. Collaboration Plan: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.

  {We will meet at least twice a week during set times in order to ensure we are on the same page and the project is moving along smoothly. Ideally most of the work will be done collaboratively, especially with the computer vision aspect, as this is new to both of us and significant learning will happen in this process. However, building out web apps or working with the API could be done independently provided the process is well documented and explained to the other person before next steps are taken.}

6. Risks and Limitations: What do you think is the biggest risk to the success of your project?

   {The biggest risk is that we are extending beyong the scope of the class and utilizing techniques that we have not yet learned. This could provide significant problems as we do not have experience in these areas and are trusting ourselves to be able to figure it out. While there are countless resources online that will be able to help us, gaining value from them could certainly be a challenge.}
