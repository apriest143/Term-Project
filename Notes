For the image to text part:
 - We can use Tesseract OCR
   - it is a free and open source libary that supports multiple languages
  
Then maybe use GPT to determine the name, date, location, and description

then store and call the info based on the date



update
- Cannot use GPT as the respository is public - not sure how to store keys
